# myReadsApp (First project from the Advanced Front-End Web Development Nanodegree Program)

A bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

# App Functionality
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:
Currently Reading
Want to Read
Read

The main page also has a link to /search, a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.
The search page has a text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets you add the book to your library.
